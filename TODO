    - DONE: Have ap_pathfind_global use cache
* Invalidate screen distance cache when items are acquired (e.g. flippers, lift)
* Figure out how keys should work with the ap_req system
    - How to encode which doors need keys?

* DONE: Indoor overlays (bombable doors)
* DONE: Reset chest states on importing maps
    - Read from SRAM

* Screen ID 0x0400 (north of Kak) has 2 transitions on the top edge that are 'guarded' by 0x02 tiles
* DONE: Key doors marked as locked right as they are being opened

* Overworld holes
* Stairs up to top of HC/escape are broken
* Second dam check
