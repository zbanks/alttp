* DONE: Pre-programmed movement for certain tasks
* Reset goal attempts count when re-visiting screens

* DONE: Cache node reachability within a screen
    - DONE: Can be used to speed up ap_pathfind_global
    - DONE: Invalidate 1 screen's worth when entering screen
    - DONE: Have ap_pathfind_global use cache
* Invalidate screen distance cache when items are acquired (e.g. flippers, lift)
* Figure out how keys should work with the ap_req system
    - How to encode which doors need keys?
* Prune "clearly invalid" unreachable, walkable edges on screens
