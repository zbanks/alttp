* DONE: With diagonal movement, need to check the corners
* Mark how to open doors in rooms (e.g. defeat all enemies)
    - Temporary workaround: SCRIPT_KILLALL
    - Future: add TASK_KILLALL
* Defeat all the stalfos in that one room in eastern palace
* Handle/detect big chest
* Bomb walls
* DONE: Pre-programmed movement for certain tasks
* Reset goal attempts count when re-visiting screens
* DONE Remove map/geography from ap_graph
* DONE: Cache node reachability within a screen
    - DONE: Can be used to speed up ap_pathfind_global
    - DONE: Invalidate 1 screen's worth when entering screen
    - DONE: Have ap_pathfind_global use cache
* Invalidate screen distance cache when items are acquired (e.g. flippers, lift)
* Figure out how keys should work with the ap_req system
    - How to encode which doors need keys?
* DONE: Prune "clearly invalid" unreachable, walkable edges on screens
    - May not be important once the whole map exists
* Avoid bomb explosions
* Indoor overlays
* DONE: Reset chest states on importing maps
    - Read from SRAM
* Re-enable jumping down ledges in the overworld
    - Fix ledge zones
    - Need to jump down ledge to get through dark cave to death mountain
* Handle fairy fountains (door 0x5e to screen 0x2369) -- stateful
    - Also fortune tellers, 0x65
    - For now, blocked
* Eastern Palace has a bunch of weird task failures around unlocking doors
* ap_pathfind_global can "jump" through long nodes
    - distance matrix is from center of src to any point on dst
* Santuary north door is a mix of 0x84 & 0x94
* Handling of 0x55 rocks; need to do lift while transitioning
